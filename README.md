# Pokemon-match-prediction-visual
using machine learning to create a prediction for pokemon match, it is visual as the output can be seen with pictures
The file that is used in the code, named as "Pokemon Dataset", is a file that contains pictures of pokemon and can be downloaded from kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arenagrenade/the-complete-pokemon-images-data-set/download?datasetVersionNumber=1)

The new files added are:- 
1. used to build a model separately
2. Predict the output in a different file by loading our model

The random forest file was too large to upload, so simply run the model and get the random forest model.
